# Introduction

The mod adds a Gizmo to any Pawn (be they Colonist, Slave, or Prisoner), which allows you to flag them to automatically extract hemogen.

This allows you to select a different Prisoner Interaction Mode, and enjoy the benefits of both.

For instance, you can set your Prisoners to "Convert" or "Recruit" or "Enslave", and still also extract hemogen while you're at it.

You can also extract hemogen from any colonist or slave.

The mod attempts to pull off the extraction while the pawn is sleeping, only putting on the Operation bill while they are settling into a long sleep, and withdrawing the Operation bill if they get too close to waking without it being completed yet.
